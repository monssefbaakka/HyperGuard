/**

 * A DLQ replay is <em>selective</em>: an operator triggers it with an explicit set of
 * {@code eventId}s (per the event replay strategy, "replay targets specific failed events by
 * {@code eventId}"). This session is the shared handoff between {@code DlqReplayService} (which
 * records the selection when a replay is triggered) and
 * {@code com.pulsestream.processor.consumer.DeadLetterEventConsumer} (which republishes only the
 * selected records and skips everything else). It also holds the inclusive/exclusive partition
 * ranges captured at trigger time, ensuring records appended during replay cannot extend the run.
 * When no replay is active the selection is empty, so the listener republishes nothing even if it
 * happens to be running.
